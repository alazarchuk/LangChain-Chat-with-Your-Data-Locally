# About this document and the author

A lot of startups (and companies that have existed for a longer time) deal with the same questions when it comes to managing people. How do you get the most out of people while being a great employer? How do you deal with performance reviews, salary changes, learning and development, recruitment, giving and getting feedback, hiring and firing?

Blendle has a mission to make quality journalism more accessible. In the last three years, we've built the HR operation at Blendle from scratch. We've tried to answer the most pressing questions. We learned through trial and error.

It has struck me how little information companies share publicly about their people operations. We would all gain a lot by being more open about what works well and what doesn't.

That's why we decided to make Blendle's Employee Handbook publicly accessible. You can find the result of three years of hard work here.

When I pressed 'publish public' I got a sense of why there is so little practical information about this topic out there. It's pretty scary to just publish it. So, here's an instant disclaimer: this is a living document, it's not perfect and we'll improve it. Still, I hope that more companies will press the 'publish public'-button. I hope that *together* we can take the concept of 'working' to the next level. So: have fun reading. Copy as much as you'd like. And please provide us with feedback at hr@blendle.com
